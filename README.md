## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Home Assistant 2023.1.0 or later
- ConnectLife account with registered devices
- Active internet connection for cloud API access

### Method 1: HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Go to **Integrations**
3. Click the **Explore & Download Repositories** button
4. Search for "Hisense Air Conditioner"
5. Click **Download**
6. Restart Home Assistant

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub releases][releases]
2. Extract the archive
3. Copy the `custom_components/hisense_ac_plugin` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
4. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Step 1: Network Configuration (Windows Users)

For proper OAuth2 authentication, you need to configure local DNS resolution:

1. Navigate to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\`
2. Right-click on the `hosts` file and select "Edit"
3. Add the following line:
   ```
   127.0.0.1 homeassistant.local
   ```
4. Save the file

**Note**: This step is required for the OAuth2 redirect to work properly during setup.

### Step 2: Add Integration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "Hisense Air Conditioner"
4. Follow the configuration flow

### Step 3: Authentication

1. Enter your ConnectLife account credentials
2. Complete the OAuth2 authorization process
3. Wait for device discovery to complete

**Important**:

- Disable VPN/proxy services during setup
- Ensure your ConnectLife account has devices registered
- The initial sync may take 1-2 minutes

## Usage

### Climate Control

The integration creates climate entities for each air conditioning unit:

```yaml
# Example automation
automation:
  - alias: "Cool down at night"
    trigger:
      platform: time
      at: "22:00:00"
    action:
      service: climate.set_temperature
      target:
        entity_id: climate.living_room_ac
      data:
        temperature: 24
        hvac_mode: cool
```

### Energy Monitoring

Energy consumption sensors are created automatically:

- `sensor.{device_name}_daily_energy`: Daily energy consumption (kWh)
- `sensor.{device_name}_power`: Current power consumption (W)

### Zone Control

For multi-zone systems, individual zone switches are created:

- `switch.{device_name}_zone_1`: Zone 1 control
- `switch.{device_name}_zone_2`: Zone 2 control

## Entity Types

| Platform         | Description                   | Example Entities                   |
|------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Climate**      | AC units, heat pumps          | `climate.living_room_ac`           |
| **Sensor**       | Temperature, humidity, energy | `sensor.bedroom_temperature`       |
| **Switch**       | Zones, special functions      | `switch.turbo_mode`                |
| **Number**       | Target values, settings       | `number.display_brightness`        |
| **Humidifier**   | Dehumidifier control          | `humidifier.basement_dehumidifier` |
| **Water Heater** | Hot water systems             | `water_heater.main_unit`           |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Failed

**Symptom**: Login fails or shows "Invalid credentials"

**Solution**:

- Verify your ConnectLife username and password
- Ensure 2FA is disabled temporarily during setup
- Try logging into the ConnectLife app to verify credentials

#### Device Not Found

**Symptom**: No devices appear after setup

**Solution**:

- Verify devices are online in the ConnectLife app
- Check internet connectivity
- Restart the integration from **Settings** → **Devices & Services**

#### OAuth2 Redirect Error

**Symptom**: "Page not found" after login

**Solution**:

- Ensure the hosts file modification was completed correctly
- Restart your browser
- Disable VPN/proxy services

#### Connection Timeout

**Symptom**: Integration shows "Unavailable" status

**Solution**:

- Check Home Assistant logs for specific error messages
- Verify ConnectLife service status
- Restart Home Assistant

### Debug Logging

To enable debug logging, add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.hisense_ac_plugin: debug
```
